### AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

- AJAX Response can be in
-- XML<entry></entry>
-- JSON {property: data}
-- HTML <div></div>

### What is the difference between Asynchronous Vs Synchronous Requests?
- When you execute something synchronously, you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task. When you execute something asynchronously, you can move on to another task before it finishes.
- An asynchronous request can be fired off at any time (before or after a page has loaded) and the response to an asynchronous request often includes HTML that can be dynamically inserted into a page.

- Facebook uses a lot of asynchronous requests so that the page almost never needs to refresh for users to see new content.

- Take a moment to consider when Facebook might take advantage of asynchronous requests to load new content without refreshing the page. Think about user actions that might lead to asynchronous requests. For instance, when a user scrolls down in a business' page (like Udacity's Facebook page), new stories get inserted into the page which never needs to refresh to show new content (more on this specific example in a moment). This is an example of an asynchronous request.
