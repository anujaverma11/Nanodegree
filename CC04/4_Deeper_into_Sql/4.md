### Normalization

- Every Row has the same number of columns.
- There is a unique key and everything in a row says something about the key.
- Facts that don't relate to the key belong in different tables.
- Tables shouldn't imply relationship that don't exist.

### Creating Primary Key with Multiple Columns

```
create table postal_places (
  postal_code text,
  country text,
  name text,
  primary key(postal_code, country)
);
```

### Self Joins
```
select a.id, b.id, a.building, a.room
  from residences as a, residences as b
where a.building = b.building
and a.room = b.room
and a.id < b.id
order by a.building, a.room;
```
